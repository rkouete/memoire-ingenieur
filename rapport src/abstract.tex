The applications of biometrics becoming more and more nowadays. Facial recognition is a non-intrusive and contactless biometric technology. These characteristics make it an area of ​​research with abundant publications. Although many methods and face recognition techniques have been proposed, it remains a difficult problem, because external factors such as illumination variation, variation of poses and facial expressions are not always treated satisfactory manner in most algorithms. Nowadays identification systems and biometric verification is a good alternative to traditional authentication.

This thesis treat of automatic face recognition on a photo or a video stream. Two recognition methods are presented: the Eigenface method using the principal components analysis and the Local Binary Patterns method (LBP). These two algorithms were tested on ORL and YALE database and the results show that LBP technical work best.
